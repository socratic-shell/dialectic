# Implementation Phases

*This chapter outlines the planned development phases for Dialectic.*

## Phase 1: MVP Review Display

**Goal**: Basic review display and navigation

- Minimal MCP server with `present-review` tool (replace mode only)
- VSCode extension with review panel
- Markdown rendering with clickable `file:line` references
- Click navigation to jump to code locations
- Basic update capabilities (`replace` mode)

**Success Criteria**: Can display reviews and navigate to referenced code

## Phase 2: Review Management

**Goal**: Enhanced review operations

- Support for `update-section` and `append` modes
- Review history and persistence
- Improved error handling and validation

**Success Criteria**: Can update reviews incrementally without full replacement

## Phase 3: Git Integration

**Goal**: Commit creation from reviews

- "Create Commit" functionality
- Review content as commit messages
- Proper formatting for git history

**Success Criteria**: Can create commits with review-based messages

## Future Work

Features that would enhance Dialectic but are not essential for core functionality:

### Automatic Reference Synchronization
- Bookmark synchronization as code changes
- Automatic line number updates in reviews
- Stable reference tracking through refactors

### Advanced UI Features
- Review templates and customization
- Multiple review tabs/sessions
- Review comparison and history
- Syntax highlighting in code snippets

### Enhanced Integration
- LSP integration for enhanced code understanding
- Integration with other development tools
- Team collaboration features
- Review sharing and discussion

### Developer Experience
- Review style guides and linting
- Performance optimizations for large codebases
- Offline review capabilities

*This roadmap will be refined as we progress through implementation and gather user feedback.*
