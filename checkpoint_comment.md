**Checkpoint: Issue #20 Complete - Ask Socratic Shell Integration** âœ…

**Session summary:**
- Implemented terminal registry in VSCode extension to track active MCP server shell PIDs
- Added `Set<number> activeTerminals` to DaemonClient class with add/remove on Polo/Goodbye messages
- Exposed `getActiveTerminals()` API method for Ask Socratic Shell integration
- Updated activate function to return API object for external access
- Added comprehensive logging with `[REGISTRY]` prefix to show active terminal list

**Architecture Achievement:**
The multi-window message bus architecture is now complete with full Ask Socratic Shell integration:

1. **Daemon Infrastructure** âœ… - Message bus with Unix socket claiming and VSCode lifecycle monitoring
2. **Protocol Updates** âœ… - Marco-Polo discovery protocol with shell PID routing
3. **Ask Socratic Shell Integration** âœ… - Terminal registry enables intelligent routing

**Key Technical Implementation:**
- Extension maintains `activeTerminals: Set<number>` updated on discovery messages
- `getActiveTerminals()` returns copy to prevent external modification
- API exposed via activate function return value for Ask Socratic Shell access
- Registry logging shows real-time terminal list: `[REGISTRY] Active terminals: [12345, 67890]`

**User Experience Impact:**
- **Before**: No way for Ask Socratic Shell to know which terminals have MCP servers
- **After**: Ask Socratic Shell can filter terminal list against active MCP servers
- **Result**: Intelligent routing - single match auto-routes, multiple matches show dropdown

**Phase 2 Progress: 95% â†’ 100% COMPLETE** ðŸŽ‰
- âœ… Update message format to include routing metadata (terminal_shell_pid)
- âœ… Modify MCP server to connect as client (not direct socket)  
- âœ… Update extension to connect as client with message handling
- âœ… **COMPLETE**: Ask Socratic Shell integration with terminal registry

**Success Criteria: ALL ACHIEVED** âœ…
- âœ… Reviews appear in correct VSCode window based on terminal origin
- âœ… Multiple VSCode windows work simultaneously without interference  
- âœ… Robust reconnection when extensions restart or MCP servers start/stop
- âœ… Clean daemon lifecycle (auto-spawn, auto-cleanup)
- âœ… **NEW**: Ask Socratic Shell can discover and route to active MCP servers

**Impact on approach:**
Issue #20 is architecturally complete. The message bus daemon provides robust multi-window support, and the terminal registry enables Ask Socratic Shell to make intelligent routing decisions. The implementation is clean, well-tested, and ready for production use.

**Progress:** Issue #20 complete. Multi-window message bus architecture with Ask Socratic Shell integration fully implemented and tested.
